'''
Implement a generator function that takes one argument:

iterable â€” iterable object
The function must return a generator that generates a sequence of tuples, each of which contains the next element
of the iterable object, as well as the previous and subsequent elements:

(<previous element>, <next element>, <next element>)
For the first element, the previous value is considered to be None, for the last element, the next value is also
considered to be None.

Note 1: The elements of the iterable object in the generator returned by the function must be in their original order.

Note 2: It is guaranteed that the iterable object passed to the function is not a set.
