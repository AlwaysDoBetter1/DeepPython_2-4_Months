'''
Implement a grouper() function that takes two arguments in the following order:

iterable â€” iterable object
n - natural number
The function must return an iterator that generates a sequence whose elements are the adjacent elements
of the iterable object, combined into tuples of n elements. If the element does not have enough neighbors,
then the value becomes None.

Note 1: The elements of the iterable object in the iterator returned by the function must be in their original order.

Note 2: It is guaranteed that the iterable object passed to the function is not a set.
